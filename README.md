Running the project is quite simple as I have kept all the dependent files in same folder. Follow the steps given below 

•	To run the project first, unzip project and open the project folder.
•	Now open command prompt and go to project folder path
e.g 
C:\IU>cd Project_BDAA

When you are in project folder now start web server by using following command

C:\IU\Project_BDAA>python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 ... 

•	Web server is up and running, so open any web browser and type in
http://localhost:8000/index.html and hit enter. You can see different dashboards by using drop down.
